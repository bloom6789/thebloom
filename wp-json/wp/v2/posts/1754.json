However, discerning between the various types of hair enhancements, especially those crafted from real human hair, is crucial for achieving a natural and seamless appearance. Here&#8217;s a guide to help you differentiate between different types of hair extensions and wigs:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Material Quality<\/strong>: Authentic human hair extensions and wigs have a distinct feel and appearance compared to synthetic alternatives. Real hair offers a natural texture that blends effortlessly with your own hair, while synthetic hair might have an artificial sheen.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Heat Styling<\/strong>: Human hair extensions and wigs can be heat-styled just like your own hair.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\n\t<div id=\"col-1904734010\" class=\"col small-12 large-12\"  >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-inner\"  >\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\">\n<p><strong>Color Variation<\/strong>: Human hair extensions come in a wide range of natural shades, making it easier to find a color that matches your own hair. Synthetic hair may have limited color options.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tangle Test<\/strong>: Gently run your fingers through the hair. Authentic human hair will feel smooth and tangle-free, whereas synthetic hair can feel coarse and tangle easily.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Realistic Movement<\/strong>: Human hair extensions and wigs move naturally, while synthetic hair may appear stiff and less lifelike.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Burning Test<\/strong>: Snip a small strand of hair and burn it. Human hair burns slowly, emits a distinct odor similar to burning hair, and turns into ash. Synthetic hair burns quickly, often with a plastic-like scent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Price Point<\/strong>: Real human hair extensions and wigs tend to be more expensive than synthetic options due to their authenticity and quality.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When choosing between hair extensions and wigs, consider your preferences, budget, and desired look. Opting for authentic human hair ensures a higher level of realism and versatility, allowing you to style and maintain them just like your natural hair.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":1674,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[106],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1754"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1754"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1754\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1755,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1754\/revisions\/1755"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1674"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1754"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1754"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebloomhair.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1754"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
